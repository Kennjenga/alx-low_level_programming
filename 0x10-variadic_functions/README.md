Variadic functions are functions which may take a variable number of arguments 
and are declared with an ellipsis in place of the last parameter. 
An example of such a function is printf. A typical declaration is

int check(int a, double b, ...);

stdarg.h is a header in the C standard library of the C programming language 
that allows functions to accept an indefinite number of arguments.
[1] It provides facilities for stepping through a list of function arguments of unknown number and type. 
C++ provides this functionality in the header cstdarg
